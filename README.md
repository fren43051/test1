## Purpose and Goals
The purpose of this calculator app is to provide a simple and easy-to-use tool for performing basic arithmetic operations. The app aims to be user-friendly and efficient, making it suitable for users who need to perform quick calculations.

## Overview of `calculator.py`
The `calculator.py` file contains the code for the calculator app. It uses Python's `tkinter` library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons for digits, operations, and a display area. The app supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
