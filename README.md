## Calculator App

This is a basic calculator app built using Python's `tkinter` library. It supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Features
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Buttons for digits 0-9
- Display area for input and results

### How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the `calculator.py` file from this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `calculator.py` is located.
4. Run the following command:
   ```
   python calculator.py
   ```
5. The calculator app window should appear, and you can start using it.

### Purpose and Goals
The purpose of this calculator app is to provide a simple and easy-to-use tool for performing basic arithmetic operations. The goal is to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to quickly and accurately perform calculations.

### Overview of calculator.py
The `calculator.py` file contains the code for the calculator app. It uses Python's `tkinter` library to create the graphical user interface (GUI). The main components of the file include:
- `Calculator` class: This class defines the structure and functionality of the calculator app.
- `__init__` method: Initializes the calculator app, sets up the input and buttons frames, and creates the buttons.
- `create_buttons` method: Creates the buttons for digits, operations, and the display area.
- `click_event` method: Handles button click events, updates the display, and performs calculations.
